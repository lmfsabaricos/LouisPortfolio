## Project Description

A fun and very engaging project primarily built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The Anime Arena Project was created as a way to practice and sharpen my frontend skills with a fully interactive and creative design in mind. It showcases advanced DOM manipulation, dynamic JavaScript features, and a strong focus on user experience.

The site includes a custom loader, animated particle background, and smooth fade-in effects to elevate the presentation. Core features like the live voting chart, battle simulation with health bars, music player, and debate comment section to make it feel like a complete and immersive anime showdown. There's also a responsive quiz section and toggleable matchups — all built to be mobile-friendly and visually rich.

More features coming soon, including backend integration.
